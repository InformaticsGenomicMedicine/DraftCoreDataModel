# DraftCoreDataModel

Welcome to the DraftCoreDataModel repository! This repository contains an early version of the CoreDataModel.

## Interacting with Notebooks

To interact with the notebooks without installing or cloning the repository, you can utilize either Codespace or MyBinder. Instructions on how to use these tools are provided below.

If you're new to using Codespace, you may find the following resources helpful:

## Access Notebooks (Codespace)

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/codespaces/new?hide_repo_select=true&ref=issue-dev-sb&repo=670718709&skip_quickstart=true&machine=standardLinux32gb&geo=UsEast)

## 1. Starting Codespace
- Start off by clicking the Codespaces badge above to get started.
- A prompt to build a code space will pop up with certain specifications.
- Click on Create Codespace.
- NOTE: This will take a few minutes to build your virtual machine.

## 2. Selecting Kernel:
- Navigate to notebooks and select a notebook you wish to run.
- Locate the "Select Kernel" option on the top right-hand side of the interface.
- Click on "Select Kernel".

## 3. Choosing Python Environment:
- After clicking "Select Kernel", choose "Python Environment...".
- From the dropdown menu, select the Pipenv Environment labeled: `DraftCoreDataModel-`.

## 4. Running Notebooks:
- Once the appropriate kernel is selected, you can proceed to run the cells inside of the Jupyter notebooks.


## 5. Deactivating Codespace
- On the bottom left corner of your browser, click on "CodeSpaces:".
- Then click "Stop Current Codespace".
- Once this is done, you have successfully deactivated your Codespace.

## Access Notebooks (MyBinder)

**Note:** MyBinder is currently undergoing maintenance, and access to notebooks may be limited. We apologize for any inconvenience.

## Notes:
- MyBinder sessions may take a few minutes to load.
- Sessions will be disabled if the user logs off or becomes inactive for an extended period.
- While you can edit files during the session, changes won't be saved once the MyBinder tab is closed.
- To preserve changes made in MyBinder, remember to download the modified files before closing the session.
- Please note that the file `notebooks/databse_examples.ipynb` is currently non-functional due to configuration issues with a local database. We are working on resolving this.

Thank you for your patience and understanding! If you encounter any issues or have questions, feel free to reach out.
